	/**
	 * Wrapper function with mutex
	 * 
	* Sends a broadcast transfer.
	* If the node is in passive mode, only single frame transfers will be allowed (they will be transmitted as anonymous).
	*
	* For anonymous transfers, maximum data type ID (CanardTxTransfer::data_type_id) is limited to 3 (see specification for details).
	*
	* Please refer to the specification for more details about data type signatures (CanardTxTransfer::data_type_signature). Signature for 
	* any data type can be obtained in many ways; for example, using the generated code generated using dronecan_dsdlc (see the repository).
	*
	* Use CanardTxTransfer structure to pass the transfer parameters. The structure is initialized by the
	* canardInitTxTransfer() function.
	* 
	* Pointer to the Transfer ID (CanardTxTransfer::inout_transfer_id) should point to a persistent variable
	* (e.g. static or heap allocated, not on the stack); it will be updated by the library after every transmission. 
	* The Transfer ID value cannot be shared between transfers that have different descriptors!
	* More on this in the transport layer specification.
	*
	* Returns the number of frames enqueued, or negative error code.
